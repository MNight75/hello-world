# hello-world

Greetings Readers

Roy here, and I am starting out on GITHUB.com for my very first repo. No no, I am not taking your car away, you aren't late on the payments are you? 

Repo is short for repository for those of you who aren't computer literate, but if you aren't computer literate, I am not sure how you found this. 

Yes, I am full of much _pun-ishment_ for you, get used to it. Its my repository and you are just a visitor.
